ScanOps 🕵️‍♂️💻 - Network Intelligence Tool

ScanOps is a powerful network intelligence and port scanning tool designed for educational purposes. This tool helps you perform detailed scans, identify operating systems, gather important network information, and more!

Key Features:
---------------
- 🔍 Scan Ports: Scan open ports on a target domain or IP address, and get detailed information about each open port.
- 🧠 OS Identification: Use TTL (Time-To-Live) values to guess the target's operating system.
- 🔐 SSL Certificate Info: Retrieve SSL certificate details of the target domain, including the subject, issuer, and validity period.
- 🌐 DNS & WHOIS Info: Get domain-specific DNS and WHOIS data such as IP address, reverse DNS, registrar, and organization.
- 📊 HTTP Headers: Extract HTTP headers for any domain.
- 📁 Save Reports: All results are saved in an easy-to-read JSON format for future reference.
